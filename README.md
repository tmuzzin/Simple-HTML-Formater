# Simple-HTML-Formater

This is a very simple Python script for indenting HTML code. I found it useful for cleaning up some very hacking HTML for a downloaded template.

Simply drop this script into a directory of HTML files and run the command on the CMD line and it will scane every HTML and reformat to a nicely indented document.

It is recommend that you install virtualenv and install all the requirements from the requirements.txt file
