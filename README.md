# Simple-HTML-Formater

This is a very simple Python script for indenting HTML code. I found it useful for cleaning up some very hacking HTML for a downloaded template.

Simply drop this script into a directory of HTML files and run the command on the CMD line and it will scan every HTML file and reformat to a nicely indented document. You can also specify the file type you want, like PHP or other code that html to be indented.

`python html_format.py php`

It is recommend that you install virtualenv and install all the requirements from the requirements.txt file
